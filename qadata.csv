We -generally- see warmer air to the south and cooler air to the north because of the energy balance from the incoming solar radiation we learned about before. This temperature difference leads to a pressure difference from south to north (again generally speaking) so this S to N gradient creates a wind which is then turned to the right from the coriolis force.
