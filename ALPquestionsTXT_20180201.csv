"So is it the coriolis force that causes the wind to come from the west?	It's not the only reason but is a contributing factor. We -generally- see warmer air to the south and cooler air to the north because of the energy balance from the incoming solar radiation we learned about before. This temperature difference leads to a pressure difference from south to north (again generally speaking) so this S to N gradient creates a wind which is then turned to the right from the coriolis force.

The DEWPOINT is defined as the temperature at which air on a given day is completely saturated. (i.e. the max value).

""I believe it's because at nighttime", there is no incoming solar radiation, so there is only the effects of the outgoing longwave radiation which cools the earth dramatically.

"Just to clarify, why would A or C be answer? Is it because the NET difference isn't as LARGE as the NIGHTTIME in the Arctic? Like with A, we know it will be hot, as well as C (daytime in Arctic) but it isnt the MOST noticeable compared to the ARCTIC at night?	""I believe it's because at nighttime", there is no incoming solar radiation, so there is only the effects of the outgoing longwave radiation which cools the earth dramatically. Greenhouse gases form a sort of insulating blanket that trap outgoing longwave radiation and keep the earth warmer. Since we expect the arctic to be cooler to begin with, and temperatures are higher than they should be," we can see the presence of greenhouse gases more clearly than in the tropics where it is warmer.""",,
"Does all the previous exams in FILES, cover the same content with this class?	""Mostly yes", but because we have skipped around a little with hurricanes," hurricanes will be on this exam when I think they are on Exam 3 in the files. Whatever we have covered IN LECTURE will be on the exam.""",,,,
