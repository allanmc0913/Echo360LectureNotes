Usually, the moistureflow into a low pressure system will be on the south and east side of the low pressure. The cyclonic winds rotate this moisture around the low pressure system. Much of the moisture is lost as the air advects around the low pressure system and rises along the slope of the warm front. The precipitation on the back side of a low pressure system is often weaker in intensity as compared to both the precipitation along the fronts and in the warm sector of the low pressure. The wrap-around precipitation can be thought of as precipitation from the left over moisture that has made its way around the low pressure system.",
